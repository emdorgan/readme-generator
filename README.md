# Readme Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This app generates a quality `README.md` with a working table of contents and a section for installation, usage, contribution guidelines, test instructions, ways to reach the user along with 3 license options to choose from (or the option to not choose any license). The page is automatically populated with the input provided by the user and saved to a file called `YourREADME.md`.

## Getting Started

* First, make sure you have a terminal viewer installed (such as Git Bash).
* Next, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* Open up your terminal.
* Navigate to the readme-generator folder using `cd <directory name>` to change directories (use the `ls` command to see files in your current directory).
* Run the command 'npm install' and wait for packages to install.
* Finally, enter the command 'node index.js" and follow the promps.
* Once you've answered the prompts, the readme will be generated and called "`YourREADME.md`".
